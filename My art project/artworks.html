            <h1>Starry night</h1>
            <p>"Starry Night" is one of Vincent van Gogh's most famous and celebrated works.
                Created in June 1889, it depicts the view from Van Gogh's window at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence, France, where he resided for a year.
                <br>
                The painting is renowned for its swirling, turbulent sky filled with stars, a crescent moon, and a radiant nebula. The village below is depicted in a tranquil manner, with darkened buildings and a steeple rising above the horizon. A tall cypress tree dominates the foreground, reaching towards the sky.
                <br>
                Van Gogh's use of bold colors and dynamic brushwork reflects his emotional and psychological state at the time. He described the painting in a letter to his brother Theo as a "battle between the darkness and the light."
                <br>
                Despite its fame today, "Starry Night" was not well-received during Van Gogh's lifetime. He struggled with mental illness and poverty, and it was only after his death that his work gained widespread recognition and acclaim.
                <br>
                Today, "Starry Night" is considered one of the most iconic and influential works of art in history. It resides in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, where it continues to inspire millions of visitors each year.
